If you already set the same 'loose' mode for these plugins in your config, it's possible that they are enabled multiple times with different options.
You can re-run Babel with the BABEL_SHOW_CONFIG_FOR environment variable to show the loaded configuration:
	npx cross-env BABEL_SHOW_CONFIG_FOR=/Users/alethiaquintero/solar_opposites_island/app/javascript/channels/index.js <your build command>
See https://babeljs.io/docs/configuration#print-effective-configs for more info.
